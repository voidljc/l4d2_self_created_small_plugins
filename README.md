This repository contains a collection of small SourceMod plugins I am developing while learning.

Each plugin focuses on a simple or interesting idea, usually exploring a specific gameplay behavior or mechanic.
They are not intended to be large or complex systems, and some implementations may be incomplete or imperfect as part of the learning process.

The goal of these plugins is experimentation and practice: trying ideas, understanding how the engine behaves, and gradually improving through iteration.
If you find something useful, feel free to adapt or improve it.
