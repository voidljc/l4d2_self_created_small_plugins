This repository contains a collection of small, focused SourceMod plugins.

Each plugin is designed to solve a specific gameplay or engine-level problem with minimal scope and explicit behavior. 
Rather than introducing broad rewrites or heavy logic layers, these plugins aim to make precise, well-contained adjustments that respect existing game systems.

Common design principles across the plugins include:
- Clear and narrow responsibility per plugin
- Explicit constraints and predictable behavior
- Avoidance of engine-wide side effects
- Emphasis on correctness and maintainability over feature breadth

These plugins are intended to be readable, configurable, and safe to integrate into existing servers without requiring invasive changes.
